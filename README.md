# OTel iOS Reliability Lab

An evidence-first lab for measuring how reliably an iOS app delivers
OpenTelemetry spans when networks and application lifecycles are hostile.

## Research question

How many spans survive collector outages, temporary network loss, backgrounding,
termination, and relaunch—and what does persistence change?

## Principles

- Every claim links to a reproducible experiment ID.
- Generated and received sequence IDs are reconciled, not estimated.
- Failures, abandoned approaches, and negative results remain in the history.
- Screenshots support raw evidence; they never replace it.
- Dependency versions, device runtime, commands, and timestamps are recorded.

## Planned comparison

1. Standard `BatchSpanProcessor` with OTLP/gRPC.
2. Standard `BatchSpanProcessor` with OTLP/HTTP.
3. The official `PersistenceSpanExporterDecorator` around each transport.
4. Any corrective implementation justified by observed failure modes.

## Repository map

- `App/`: iOS experiment controller and live delivery ledger.
- `Packages/ReliabilityCore/`: deterministic experiment models and reconciliation.
- `collector/`: local OpenTelemetry Collector configuration.
- `experiments/`: immutable plans and summarized results by experiment ID.
- `evidence/`: screenshots and checksummed raw observations.
- `docs/lab-notebook/`: chronological decisions, failures, and discoveries.
- `article/`: article outline and draft backed by experiment IDs.

## Status

The lab is being bootstrapped. Dependency inspection found an official
`PersistenceSpanExporterDecorator`, so the first durable comparison will test it
before considering custom persistence. No reliability claim is valid until its
experiment has a committed plan, raw evidence, and reconciliation report.
